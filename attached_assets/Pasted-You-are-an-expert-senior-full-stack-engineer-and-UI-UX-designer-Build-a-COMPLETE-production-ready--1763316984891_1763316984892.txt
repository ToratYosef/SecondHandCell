You are an expert senior full-stack engineer and UI/UX designer.

Build a COMPLETE production-ready B2B wholesale buying platform called **“SecondHand(Whole)Cell”** using **Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui + Prisma + PostgreSQL + NextAuth + Stripe**.

This is a REAL app, not a demo. Do not leave TODOs or placeholders. Implement every page, component, route, and piece of copy described below. If something is mentioned, create it.

---

## TECH + ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

- **Framework:** Next.js 14 with the App Router (`app/` directory).
- **Language:** TypeScript everywhere (pages, components, server code).
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components. Clean, modern, light theme by default.
- **DB:** PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM.
- **Auth:** NextAuth with Credentials provider (email + password login) and role-based access:
  - Roles: `"buyer"`, `"admin"`, `"super_admin"`.
- **Payments:** Stripe for card payments and recording “wire / ACH / offline” payment methods in DB.
- **Forms & Validation:** React Hook Form + Zod.
- **API Layer:** Next.js Route Handlers under `app/api/...` for all CRUD.
- **Directory structure:**
  - `app/(public)/...` – marketing + buyer-facing pages
  - `app/(buyer)/...` – logged-in buyer area
  - `app/(admin)/admin/...` – admin portal
  - `lib/` – helpers, utilities, config
  - `components/` – shared UI components

Use good file naming and organization. All key features must be implemented.

## CORE BUSINESS CONCEPT

SecondHand(Whole)Cell is a wholesale buying platform where **resellers, refurbishers, and dealers** can:

- Browse a **live catalog of used/refurbished devices** (phones, tablets, smartwatches, laptops).

- Place **bulk orders** with shipping and payments.
- Request **custom quotes** and manage them.
- Manage their **company account, addresses, tax info, and reseller documentation**.
- View **order history, invoices, and credit status**.

Admins manage:

- Inventory and pricing (including tiers and quantity breaks).
- Customer accounts and approval.
- Quotes, orders, payments, and shipments.
- Content (homepage banners, FAQs).
- Reports and analytics.

- Make sure navigation links are correct and consistent across layouts.

Build this entire application in a way that it can run with:

1. `npm install`
2. `npx prisma migrate dev`
3. `npm run dev`
